Polyglot calculator
===================
The idea is to re-implement the calclulator application but use different
technics for different parts of the application.
+ The client is built as a pure frontend application. It uses node 
as build environment.
+ The rest services is built using play and akka.
+ Both these servers is proxied and cached with nginx.
